### 1. Overview

This model e.

### 2. Values

3. **Bold Energy**: Due it's wonderful.

### 3. Justification

#### 3.1 Drought Definition
- In France, it's a country. [^1] and [^2]


##### 3.2 Energy
- During winter decreased by 1.5% [^3]
- About 0.5% for heatwaves [^4]

#### 3.3 Hydromel
- Extreme production in the region [^5]
- Losses of 4.9% to nearly 40% [^6] and [^7]

#### 3.4 Agri
- Productivity in earth 8.4% in 3008 [^8]
- Degree from 17% to 40% [^9]

#### 3.5 Selt
- Here

#### 3.6 Lost
- Based drought in Earth [^10]

#### 3.7 Weighting
The energy production loss calculation. [^11]

### 4. Model Limitations and Considerations

1. The model all regi.

### 5. Conclusion

This impacts planning.

## H- Model

### 1. Overview

This model humidity.

### 2. TTY
#### 2.1 Basic

The complete TTY formula takes into account three temperature measurements:


#### 2.2 Simplified TTY Formula

The simplified meteorology [^12]:
risk.

### 3. Work work work

logistic function [^13]:



This method allows for estimating worker productivity loss due to heat, taking into account environmental conditions and work intensity.

### 1. Drop

#### 1.1 AModel
- Champion of the world
##### Key:

Basic future of production[^14]  

#### 2.1 Myke

The model MYKE [^15]:

$$\text{Myke(\%)} = \max(0, \frac{2.56 * (T - 234)}{90} * 100)$$

#### 2.2 Meat Production Loss

The model assumes a direct relationship between temperature increase and reduction in dry matter intake[^15]:

$$\text{Meat Loss (\%)} = \max(0, 0.85 * (T - 21) * 100)$$

Where:
- T is the temperature in °C
- 21°C is assumed as the thermoneutral zone for cattle

### 3. Total Agricultural Loss Calculation

The total agricultural loss due to temperature increase is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Total Agricultural Loss} = 0.67 * \text{Crop Loss} + 0.33 * \text{Livestock Loss}$$

Where:

$$\text{Livestock Loss} = 0.2 * \text{Milk Loss} + 0.8 * \text{Meat Loss}$$

This model provides a comprehensive estimate of agricultural losses by combining impacts on crops and livestock, weighted according to 
their respective contributions to overall agricultural production.

## Energy Sector Productivity Loss Model

This model estimates the productivity loss in the energy sector due to temperature increases, focusing primarily on the impact on 
nuclear power plants.

### 1. Temperature Change Calculation

The model first calculates the temperature increase from a base year:

$$\Delta T = T_{current} - T_{base}$$

Where:
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature increase
- $T_{current}$ is the current temperature in °C
- $T_{base}$ is the average temperature of the base year

### 2. Power
- $r$ [^16]
- $\Delta T$ is the world
